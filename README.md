# Maps of Parler video activity in Europe

A repository for maps of Parler video uploads in Europe. I decided to create the maps after seeing two other repositories that accessed and processed the same data, the repository of [philshem](https://github.com/philshem/parler-switzerland) and that of [zumbov2](https://github.com/zumbov2/parler-video-metadata/tree/main). Their examples also helped me to process the data myself.

The data behind the maps can be downloaded [here](https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Parler). Each observation marks the upload of a video from the alt-tech/alt-right social media platform Parler. Metadata is automatically uploaded for videos, that have not disabled this function, which includes coordinates.

An example of the maps can be seen in the map of the United Kingdom shown below. The United Kingdom is the country in Europe with the most video uploads from Parler.
